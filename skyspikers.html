                <h2>Elite Warm-up & Strength Training</h2>
                
                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>1. Dynamic Stretching (5-10 Mins)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Arm circles, leg swings, and torso twists. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> To "lubricate" joints and increase blood flow. Cold muscles are brittle; dynamic stretching prepares them for explosive contractions, preventing muscle fiber tears.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>2. Jumping Squats (3 Sets x 15)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Lower into a deep squat and explode vertically with maximum force. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> This develops <b>Vertical Power</b>. Volleyball relies on "Explosive Strength" in the legs for blocking and attacking above the net height.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>3. Planks & Core Rotations (3 Sets x 30 Seconds)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Hold plank position and rotate your torso side to side. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Your core is your power center. A strong core allows for "Mid-air Control" and ensures maximum power transfer from your legs to your hitting arm while protecting your spine.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>4. Lateral Shuffles (Suicide Drills)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Rapid side-to-side shuffling between court lines. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Volleyball is a game of lateral speed. This drills the "Neuromuscular Response" in your ankles and knees, preparing them for the rapid direction changes needed in defense.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>5. Burpees (Full Body Explosion - 3 Sets x 10)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> A rapid transition from a push-up to a vertical jump. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> It builds extreme cardiovascular stamina and mimics the act of "Diving" for a ball and recovering instantly to stay in the play.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>6. Wall Sits (3 Sets x 45 Seconds)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Sit against a wall with your knees at 90 degrees. Hold the position. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Builds leg endurance and strengthens the muscles you use to stay low in defensive positions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>7. Box Jumps (3 Sets x 12)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Jump onto a raised platform or box with both feet, then step down. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Increases explosive jumping power needed for spiking and blocking. Trains fast-twitch muscle fibers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>8. Shoulder Strengthening - Band Pulls (3 Sets x 15)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Use resistance bands to pull in different directions (front, side, rotations). 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Strengthens rotator cuff muscles to prevent shoulder injuries from repetitive spiking and serving.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>9. Medicine Ball Slams (3 Sets x 12)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Lift a medicine ball overhead and slam it down to the ground with force. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Mimics the spiking motion and builds explosive upper body power and core strength.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>10. Cool Down - Static Stretching (5-10 Mins)</h3>
                    <p><b>Exercise:</b> Hold stretches for hamstrings, quads, shoulders, and back for 20-30 seconds each. 
                    <br><b>Why?</b> Helps muscles recover, reduces soreness, and increases flexibility for better range of motion.</p>

                <h2>Professional Safety Protocol</h2>
                
                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>Knee Pads (Ligament Shield)</h3>
                    <p><b>Technical Detail:</b> Ankle inversion sprains are the #1 injury in volleyball. This occurs when a player lands on an opponent's or teammate's foot at the net. 
                    <br><b>Why it's vital:</b> Professional braces act as external ligaments. They restrict the dangerous lateral rolling of the ankle while allowing the vertical flexion needed for jumping.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>Volleyball Shoes (The Gum Rubber Advantage)</h3>
                    <p><b>Technical Detail:</b> You must use shoes with <b>Gum Rubber Soles</b>. 
                    <br><b>Why it's vital:</b> Indoor gym floors are slippery. Gum rubber reacts with the floor's friction to provide a "sticky" grip. Running shoes lack this, leading to slips that cause ACL (Knee) tears during sudden stops.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>Apparel Standards (Performance Fabrics)</h3>
                    <p><b>Technical Detail:</b> 100% moisture-wicking Polyester/Synthetic blends only. 
                    <br><b>Why it's vital:</b> Cotton absorbs sweat, becomes heavy, and causes severe skin chafing. Tight-fitting jerseys are mandatory to prevent "Net Touch" fouls, as loose clothing often catches on the net mesh.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h3>❌ ABSOLUTE ZERO ACCESSORIES POLICY</h3>
                    <p><b>All jewelry and hardware must be removed. There are NO exceptions due to the following hazards:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Rings:</b> Can catch in the net mesh during a block, leading to "Ring Avulsion"—a catastrophic finger injury.</li>
                        <li><b>Earrings/Piercings:</b> A high-speed volleyball (traveling up to 100km/h) hitting an earring can drive the metal post into the skull or tear the earlobe instantly.</li>
                        <li><b>Watches/Bracelets:</b> These can shatter upon contact during a pass, causing deep lacerations to you or your teammates.</li>
                        <li><b>Necklaces:</b> Risk of strangulation or snapping and causing eye injuries during rapid jumping movements.</li>
                        <li><b>Hair:</b> Must be secured. Loose hair causes "Momentary Blindness" during serves or hits, which is a major safety risk.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1. The Set (Setting Up Your Teammate)</h3>
                    <p><b>How to do it:</b> Position yourself under the ball. Make a triangle shape with your hands above your forehead. Use your fingertips (not your palms) to push the ball up and toward your teammate. Push with your legs, not just your arms.
                    <br><b>Why it matters:</b> The setter controls where the ball goes. A good set makes it easy for your teammate to spike the ball.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>2. Pass (Receiving the Ball)</h3>
                    <p><b>How to do it:</b> Hold your arms straight and put your hands together. Make a flat platform with your forearms. Don't swing your arms - let the ball bounce off them. Bend your knees and use your legs to aim the ball.
                    <br><b>Why it matters:</b> Passing is the first touch. A good pass makes everything else easier.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>3. Hitting/Spiking (Attacking the Ball)</h3>
                    <p><b>How to do it:</b> Take three steps: Left foot, Right foot, then Left-Right together quickly. Jump as high as you can. Swing your arm and snap your wrist down over the ball to make it go down fast into the other court.
                    <br><b>Why it matters:</b> This is how you score points by hitting the ball hard into the opponent's side.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-item">
                    <h3>4. Underhand Serve (Easy Serve)</h3>
                    <p><b>How to do it:</b> Hold the ball in your non-hitting hand. Stand with one foot forward. Make a fist with your hitting hand. Swing your arm like a pendulum and hit the bottom of the ball with your fist. The ball should go up and over the net.
                    <br><b>Why it matters:</b> This is the easiest serve to learn. Every point starts with a serve, so you must get the ball over the net.</p>

                    <p><b>Primary Role:</b> The team's defensive anchor and quick-tempo attacker. Plays in Zone 3 (Front Center).
                    <br><b>Key Skills:</b> Reading the setter, elite blocking technique, quick-tempo attacks (1-sets, slides), extreme lateral speed along the net
                    <br><b>Physical Requirements:</b> Tallest player on team (typically 6'4"+ for men, 6'0"+ for women), fastest lateral movement, explosive vertical jump
                    <br><b>Starting Position:</b> Middle front (Zone 3) in offensive rotation, middle back (Zone 6) when in back row
                    <br><b>Tactical Responsibility:</b> Close the block on both sides, run quick attacks to split the opponent's block, transition defense after blocks, protect against quick middle attacks
                    <br><b>Special Note:</b> Often substituted out when rotating to back row and replaced by a Libero</p>

                    <p><b>Primary Role:</b> The team's right-side attacker who plays opposite the setter in rotation. The "go-to" hitter in pressure situations.
